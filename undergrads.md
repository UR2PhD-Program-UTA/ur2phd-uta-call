Your total hours across this program plus any other on-campus work (paid or unpaid) must be 20 hours/week or less. If you plan to count hours already worked in a GRA position, that is allowed, but you cannot exceed 20 total hours/week. CPT is not supported by this program.

  - SESSION A: Wednesdays 7–9PM CT  
  - SESSION B: Thursdays 6–8PM CT  
- Course runs from **February 18 – April 30, 2026**  
- Must have **no more than 2 unexcused absences**, complete all assignments, pass course (70+)
