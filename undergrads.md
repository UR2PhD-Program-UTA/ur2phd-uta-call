# Call for Undergraduate Applications - Research Experiences

Are you a CSE undergraduate interested in research and graduate school? Apply to join a **UR2PhD research cohort** or a **classic CSE Dept REU** this semester!
- [Undergrad Application Form](https://forms.office.com/r/zA3XusdpS1) 

## Timeline
**For due dates and timelines, please review the [timetable](index.html).**

## Eligibility & Commitment

### For the Classic CSE Dept REU
- For international students: The CSE Department REU is treated as training, so there is no program-imposed 20-hour limit. Still, please confirm with OIE that participation fits your visa situation.
- Commit to work on a research project through the semester
- Submit a mid-semester milestone (1 page plan + current results) by March 11. 
- Submit a final deliverable package: poster PDF + 1-2 page summary + link to artifacts (repo, design files, dataset, etc.)
- Present at Innovation Day (April 14, 2026) or other conference

### For the UR2PhD Program
- For international students: Participation counts toward the 20 hours/week on-campus employment limit. Your total hours across this program plus any other on-campus work (paid or unpaid) must be 20 hours/week or less. If you plan to count hours already worked in a GRA position, that is allowed, but you cannot exceed 20 total hours/week. CPT is not supported by this program. 

- Commit to work on a research project through the semester
- The program is cohort-based -- you and your partner (selected by faculty) must attend the same course session.
- Enroll in a virtual course. **For course dates and timelines, please review the [timetable](index.html).**
- Must have **no more than 2 unexcused absences**, complete all assignments, pass course (70+)
- Note: The course does not count towards UTA credit or your GPA; it is adminstered by the CRA organization.
- Present at Innovation Day (April 14, 2026) or other conference

## Compensation
Students who complete the course will receive a **$500 scholarship**, posted to their myMav account in the next semester.

## How to Apply
Students may apply to **only one** project. Submit your materials using the [Undergrad Application Form](https://forms.office.com/r/zA3XusdpS1) 

The application will ask you for:

- Academic information
- Three short essays
- Your resume/CV 

**For due dates and timelines, please review the [timetable](index.html).**
