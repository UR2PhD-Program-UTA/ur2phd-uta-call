# UR2PhD Proposal
- [Application Form](https://forms.office.com/r/RzaKTe3zuZ)

The UR2PhD program requires a cohort. The cohort engages in a semester-long mentored research experience supported by a national UR2PhD curriculum designed to build research identity and prepare students for graduate school. The cohort consists of:

- 1 faculty mentor  
- 1 graduate student mentor (note eligibility notes below)  
- 2 undergraduate researchers  

## Requirements
- Undergrad recruitment blurb (1-2 paragraphs), if you have not identified candidates
- Proposal (2 page max) - see [Template](https://ur2phd-program-uta.github.io/ur2phd-uta-call/template)
- Identified graduate mentor (must be able to enroll in the grad course); graduate mentors who have completed the course are eligible for the continuing mentor stipend  
- Two undergraduate researchers (must be able to enroll in the same undergrad course)  
  **or** clear criteria for selecting undergrads (e.g., GPA, courses, year)  

**Proposal deadline: January 19, 2026

The CSE Department will fund up to **10 cohorts**  
- $1,000 stipend for the grad mentor  
- $500 scholarship for each undergrad  
- Additional undergrads may join your project but must be supported with $500/student from non-grant funds (e.g., startup, IDC)

> **Note:** If undergraduates are not identified at submission, we will issue a call to CSE undergrads, gather applications, and allow you to select students.
