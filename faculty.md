# Call for Faculty Proposals – UR2PhD and classic REU at UTA (Fall 2025)

We invite UTA faculty to submit proposals to lead a **UR2PhD research cohort** or a classic **CSE Dept REU** during **Spring 2026**.
- [Application Form](https://forms.office.com/r/RzaKTe3zuZ)
- [Proposal Template](template.html)
  
**For due dates and timelines, please review the [timetable](index.html).**


Both programs offer the same compensation to undergraduates and use the same application materials. The key difference is staffing: UR2PhD requires an eligible graduate mentor, which is often the limiting factor, especially when domestic graduate mentor availability is tight (and international eligibility can vary).

[UR2PhD @ UTA](ur2phd.html) is the preferred option when you can secure a graduate mentor. It adds a national cohort curriculum and a documented training structure that is easier to point to for NSF REU Supplements, and for synergistic activities and broader impacts. Graduate mentors may be eligible for a $1,000 stipend (including some international students), and undergraduates who complete the course may become eligible to apply for up to $8,000 in continuation funding (limited international support). Published work can also unlock up to $2,000 in travel support.

[Classic CSE Dept REU](deptreu.html) is the fallback when a UR2PhD cohort cannot be formed. It supports the same semester-long mentored undergraduate research experience without the graduate-mentor requirement or national coursework. Faculty are responsible for ensuring students complete the required poster and presentation at Innovation Day (or a similar approved venue).

If recruitment or graduate-mentor eligibility issues arise, UR2PhD applications will be converted to the Classic CSE Dept REU to ensure projects can still move forward.

The CSE Department will fund up to **20 students across the CSE REU and UR2PhD Program**.
