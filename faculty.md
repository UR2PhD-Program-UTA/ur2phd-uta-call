# Call for Faculty Proposals – UR2PhD and classic REU at UTA (Fall 2025)

We invite UTA faculty to submit proposals to lead a **UR2PhD research cohort** or a classic **CSE Dept REU** during **Spring 2026**.
- [Application Form](https://forms.office.com/r/RzaKTe3zuZ)
  
** For due dates and timelines, please review the [timetable](index.html).**

- Choose the [Classic CSE Dept REU](deptreu.html) if you want to support an undergraduate research project through the semester with a simple, department-run structure. Mentoring expectations and undergraduate compensation are the same as UR2PhD, but this option is focused on the undergraduate experience only, with no required cohort or national coursework and no graduate-mentor component (but strongly encouraged). Your are responsible in ensuring students complete the poster and presentation requirement at Innovation Day (or similar venue). 

- Choose [UR2PhD @ UTA](ur2phd.html) if you want the same undergraduate mentoring and compensation, plus a supported graduate-mentor role and a national cohort curriculum. UR2PhD adds structured training in research methods, proposal writing, and graduate school preparation, with shared deliverables and cohort participation. From a faculty perspective, UR2PhD is often easier to point to in NSF REU Supplements and in synergistic activities and broader impacts, because it provides a documented training framework and standardized outcomes. It also includes a $1,000 graduate mentor stipend in cases where the graduate mentor is eligible (including some international students). Undergraduates who complete the course become eligible for up to $8k in funding (~10 spots per year; limited support for international students).
